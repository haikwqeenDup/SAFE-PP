# Cultivated Land Dataset README  

## Dataset Overview  
The cultivated land dataset comprises categorical features and numerical features, which collectively reflect the land characteristics of specific cultivated areas and serve as a basis for cultivated land decision-making.  


## Categorical Features (12 Attributes)  
- Soil pollution grade of classification unit  
- Soil layer thickness of classification unit  
- Soil texture of classification unit  
- Soil pollution grade of expanded classification unit  
- Soil layer thickness of expanded classification unit  
- Soil texture of expanded classification unit  
- Whether the slope is above 2°  
- Whether the slope is above 6°  
- Whether the slope is above 15°  
- Main functional area  
- Drinking water protection area grade  
- (Additional categorical attributes as applicable)  


## Numerical Features (56 Attributes)  
- Cultivated land fragmentation index  
- Proportion of high-standard farmland area  
- Proportion of cultivated land area  
- Area of permanent basic farmland  
- Area of cultivated land irrigation  
- Area of cultivated land inflow  
- Distance between cultivated land and rivers  
- Area of forest land  
- Area of paddy field  
- Area of cultivated land reserve resources  
- (56 total numerical attributes, including additional metrics such as spatial distances, area proportions, and topographical indices)  


## Dataset Structure Summary  
- **Categorical Features**: 12 attributes, capturing qualitative characteristics like soil properties, slope classifications, and functional zoning.  
- **Numerical Features**: 56 attributes, quantifying spatial metrics, area proportions, topographical parameters, and land use indicators.  

These features collectively characterize the physical, environmental, and spatial attributes of cultivated land, enabling comprehensive analysis for agricultural planning, land management, ecological protection, and policy-making.
